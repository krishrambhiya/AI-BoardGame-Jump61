This project encompasses the creation of a tile-based world exploration engine with a customizable avatar, defined winning goals, and loss mechanisms. It leverages advanced data structures such as Priority Queues, KDTrees, Nodes, and Characters to optimize time efficiency. Furthermore, the project enhances AI capabilities by optimizing A* and Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithms, enabling the AI to effectively find the best path for collecting coins and reaching the level-up tile, thereby enhancing gameplay strategy and user engagement.
